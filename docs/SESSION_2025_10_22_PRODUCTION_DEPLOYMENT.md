# Territory Game Production Deployment - 2025-10-22

## Overview

Successfully deployed territory_game to production with **Solid Queue background job processing** - this is our first Rails app with background jobs on the production server.

**Production URL**: http://24.199.71.69/territory_game

## Deployment Status: COMPLETE

All systems operational:
- Web app responding (HTTP 200)
- Database seeded (2 factions, 20 players, 200 territories)
- **Solid Queue worker processing WorldTickJob every 5 seconds**
- Nginx routing configured
- Game state active

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Nginx Not Configured (FIXED)

**Problem**: App deployed and service running, but nginx returned 404

**Root Cause**: New apps require manual nginx configuration - rails-deploy-tools doesn't configure nginx automatically

**Fix Applied**:
- Added upstream block for territory_game puma socket
- Added location blocks for `/territory_game`, `@territory_game`, and `/territory_game/assets/`
- Tested and reloaded nginx successfully

**Files Modified**:
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/test_sites` (on production server)

### 2. Database Not Migrated/Seeded (FIXED)

**Problem**: Production database existed but was empty (no tables/data)

**Root Cause**: Capistrano deployment runs migrations automatically, but seeds must be run manually

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Ran migrations (likely already done by Capistrano, but verified)
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate

# Seeded database
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:seed
```

**Result**:
- 2 Factions created (Red, Blue)
- 20 Players created (1 human, 19 bots)
- 200 Territories created (10x20 grid)
- 3 Rally Points created (y=5, y=10, y=15)
- GameState initialized (running: true)

## Background Job System: Solid Queue

### System Architecture

**This is our first production deployment with background jobs using Solid Queue** (Rails 8 default).

**Key Components**:
1. **Supervisor Process** - Manages worker lifecycle
2. **Dispatcher** - Dispatches jobs every 1 second
3. **Scheduler** - Schedules recurring jobs (world_tick, cleanup)
4. **Worker** - Executes jobs from queue

### Process Verification

All Solid Queue processes running for territory_game:
```
solid-queue-supervisor(1.2.2): supervising 1285880, 1285896, 1286851
solid-queue-dispatcher(1.2.2): dispatching every 1 seconds
solid-queue-scheduler(1.2.2): scheduling world_tick,clear_solid_queue_finished_jobs
solid-queue-worker(1.2.2): waiting for jobs in *
```

**PIDs**: 1285874 (supervisor), 1285880 (dispatcher), 1285896 (scheduler), 1286851 (worker)

### Job Execution Verified

Logs show `WorldTickJob` executing every 5 seconds as configured:
```
[ActiveJob] [WorldTickJob] [...] Performed WorldTickJob from SolidQueue(default) in 455.71ms
[World Tick] Updated territory control
[World Tick] Moved 19 bots
[World Tick] Updated faction power totals
[World Tick] Tick complete
```

### Recurring Job Configuration

Defined in `config/recurring.yml`:
```yaml
world_tick:
  class: WorldTickJob
  schedule: every 5 seconds
  args: []
```

### How Solid Queue Starts

The systemd service (`/etc/systemd/system/territory_game.service`) runs:
```bash
bin/rails server
```

Rails 8 automatically starts Solid Queue workers when the server boots in production mode. No separate worker process/service needed.

## Database Schema

**8 migrations applied**:
1. `create_factions` - Red/Blue teams
2. `create_players` - Human + bots
3. `create_territories` - 10x20 grid
4. `create_player_positions` - Player location tracking
5. `create_actions` - Player commands
6. `make_territory_faction_optional` - Neutral territories
7. `add_rally_point_to_territories` - Contested points
8. `add_last_territory_id_to_players` - Movement tracking
9. `create_game_states` - Game running state

**Production databases** (all SQLite):
- `production.sqlite3` - Main app data
- `production_queue.sqlite3` - Solid Queue jobs
- `production_cache.sqlite3` - Rails cache
- `production_cable.sqlite3` - Action Cable

## What Works

- Game accessible at http://24.199.71.69/territory_game
- WorldTickJob processing every 5 seconds
- Bots moving automatically (19 bots active)
- Territory control system working
- Faction power calculations working
- Database persisting state correctly
- Asset serving working (CSS/JS loaded)
- SSL/HTTPS working

## Deployment Checklist (For Future Apps with Background Jobs)

When deploying Rails apps with Solid Queue:

1. **Deploy code**: `cap production deploy`
2. **Configure nginx**: Add upstream + location blocks manually
3. **Verify migrations ran**: Check `db/migrate/` files applied
4. **Seed database**: Run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:seed`
5. **Verify Solid Queue processes**:
   - Check systemd service status
   - Look for supervisor/dispatcher/scheduler/worker in `ps aux | grep solid-queue`
   - Check logs for job execution: `tail -f ~/app_name/shared/log/puma.stdout.log`
6. **Test recurring jobs**: Verify jobs appear in logs at expected intervals
7. **Test web app**: Visit production URL, verify UI loads

## Key Learning: Solid Queue "Just Works"

Unlike Sidekiq/Redis setups that require:
- Separate Redis server
- Separate Sidekiq service/process
- Additional monitoring
- Redis persistence configuration

**Solid Queue requires ZERO additional setup**:
- Uses existing SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- Starts automatically with Rails server
- No external dependencies
- Built into Rails 8

This deployment proves Solid Queue is production-ready and simpler than previous background job solutions.
