# Territory Game Production Deployment - 2025-10-22

## Overview

Successfully deployed territory_game to production with **Solid Queue background job processing** - this is our first Rails app with background jobs on the production server.

**Production URL**: http://24.199.71.69/territory_game

## Deployment Status: COMPLETE

All systems operational:
- Web app responding (HTTP 200)
- Database seeded (2 factions, 20 players, 200 territories)
- **Solid Queue worker processing WorldTickJob every 5 seconds**
- Nginx routing configured
- Game state active

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Tailwind CSS Not Loading (FIXED - Critical for All Future Deployments)

**Problem**: Page rendered as plaintext with no styling - Tailwind CSS classes present in HTML but styles not applied

**Root Cause**:
- `app/assets/builds/` directory is in `.gitignore` (by design - build artifacts shouldn't be committed)
- During deployment, Capistrano runs `rails assets:precompile` which uses Propshaft
- **BUT Tailwind CSS must be built BEFORE Propshaft runs** - otherwise Propshaft packages an empty manifest file
- The Tailwind gem builds CSS into `app/assets/builds/tailwind.css` at build time, not deploy time

**Symptoms**:
- Deployed `application-*.css` was only 491 bytes (just comments, no Tailwind classes)
- Local `app/assets/builds/tailwind.css` was 13KB+ with all classes
- Page had Tailwind classes in HTML but no visual styling

**Fix Applied** (config/deploy.rb):
```ruby
namespace :assets do
  desc 'Build Tailwind CSS'
  task :build_tailwind do
    on roles(:web) do
      within release_path do
        with rails_env: fetch(:rails_env) do
          execute :bundle, 'exec', 'rails', 'tailwindcss:build'
        end
      end
    end
  end

  # ... existing precompile task ...
end

# Critical hook order:
before 'deploy:assets:precompile', 'deploy:assets:build_tailwind'
```

**Deployment Log Output** (now shows Tailwind building):
```
00:15 deploy:assets:build_tailwind
      01 bundle exec rails tailwindcss:build
      01 ≈ tailwindcss v4.1.13
      01 Done in 114ms
    ✔ 01 zac@24.199.71.69 2.299s
00:18 deploy:assets:precompile
      01 bundle exec rake assets:precompile
      01 Writing tailwind-b9cba2a2.css  ← 14KB, success!
```

**Result**:
- `tailwind-b9cba2a2.css` now 14KB (vs 491 bytes before)
- All Tailwind classes rendering correctly
- Grid layouts, colors, spacing, borders all working

**CRITICAL FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS**:
This pattern is **required for ANY Rails app using Tailwind CSS**. Add the `build_tailwind` task and hook to `config/deploy.rb` before first deployment.

**ALSO REQUIRED - Relative URL Root for Path-Based Routing**:
Apps deployed under a path (e.g., `/territory_game`) must set `relative_url_root` in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
# CRITICAL: Set relative URL root for path-based routing
config.relative_url_root = "/territory_game"
config.action_controller.relative_url_root = "/territory_game"
```

Without this, asset paths will be `/assets/...` instead of `/territory_game/assets/...` causing 404s.

### 2. Nginx Not Configured (FIXED)

**Problem**: App deployed and service running, but nginx returned 404

**Root Cause**: New apps require manual nginx configuration - rails-deploy-tools doesn't configure nginx automatically

**Fix Applied**:
- Added upstream block for territory_game puma socket
- Added location blocks for `/territory_game`, `@territory_game`, and `/territory_game/assets/`
- Tested and reloaded nginx successfully

**Files Modified**:
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/test_sites` (on production server)

### 3. Database Not Migrated/Seeded (FIXED)

**Problem**: Production database existed but was empty (no tables/data)

**Root Cause**: Capistrano deployment runs migrations automatically, but seeds must be run manually

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Ran migrations (likely already done by Capistrano, but verified)
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate

# Seeded database
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:seed
```

**Result**:
- 2 Factions created (Red, Blue)
- 20 Players created (1 human, 19 bots)
- 200 Territories created (10x20 grid)
- 3 Rally Points created (y=5, y=10, y=15)
- GameState initialized (running: true)

## Background Job System: Solid Queue

### System Architecture

**This is our first production deployment with background jobs using Solid Queue** (Rails 8 default).

**Key Components**:
1. **Supervisor Process** - Manages worker lifecycle
2. **Dispatcher** - Dispatches jobs every 1 second
3. **Scheduler** - Schedules recurring jobs (world_tick, cleanup)
4. **Worker** - Executes jobs from queue

### Process Verification

All Solid Queue processes running for territory_game:
```
solid-queue-supervisor(1.2.2): supervising 1285880, 1285896, 1286851
solid-queue-dispatcher(1.2.2): dispatching every 1 seconds
solid-queue-scheduler(1.2.2): scheduling world_tick,clear_solid_queue_finished_jobs
solid-queue-worker(1.2.2): waiting for jobs in *
```

**PIDs**: 1285874 (supervisor), 1285880 (dispatcher), 1285896 (scheduler), 1286851 (worker)

### Job Execution Verified

Logs show `WorldTickJob` executing every 5 seconds as configured:
```
[ActiveJob] [WorldTickJob] [...] Performed WorldTickJob from SolidQueue(default) in 455.71ms
[World Tick] Updated territory control
[World Tick] Moved 19 bots
[World Tick] Updated faction power totals
[World Tick] Tick complete
```

### Recurring Job Configuration

Defined in `config/recurring.yml`:
```yaml
world_tick:
  class: WorldTickJob
  schedule: every 5 seconds
  args: []
```

### How Solid Queue Starts

The systemd service (`/etc/systemd/system/territory_game.service`) runs:
```bash
bin/rails server
```

Rails 8 automatically starts Solid Queue workers when the server boots in production mode. No separate worker process/service needed.

## Database Schema

**8 migrations applied**:
1. `create_factions` - Red/Blue teams
2. `create_players` - Human + bots
3. `create_territories` - 10x20 grid
4. `create_player_positions` - Player location tracking
5. `create_actions` - Player commands
6. `make_territory_faction_optional` - Neutral territories
7. `add_rally_point_to_territories` - Contested points
8. `add_last_territory_id_to_players` - Movement tracking
9. `create_game_states` - Game running state

**Production databases** (all SQLite):
- `production.sqlite3` - Main app data
- `production_queue.sqlite3` - Solid Queue jobs
- `production_cache.sqlite3` - Rails cache
- `production_cable.sqlite3` - Action Cable

## What Works

- Game accessible at http://24.199.71.69/territory_game
- WorldTickJob processing every 5 seconds
- Bots moving automatically (19 bots active)
- Territory control system working
- Faction power calculations working
- Database persisting state correctly
- Asset serving working (CSS/JS loaded)
- SSL/HTTPS working

## Deployment Checklist (For Future Apps with Background Jobs)

When deploying Rails apps with Solid Queue:

1. **CRITICAL: Add Tailwind build task** to `config/deploy.rb` (see fix #1 above)
2. **Deploy code**: `cap production deploy`
3. **Configure nginx**: Add upstream + location blocks manually
4. **Verify migrations ran**: Check `db/migrate/` files applied
5. **Seed database**: Run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:seed`
6. **Verify Solid Queue processes**:
   - Check systemd service status
   - Look for supervisor/dispatcher/scheduler/worker in `ps aux | grep solid-queue`
   - Check logs for job execution: `tail -f ~/app_name/shared/log/puma.stdout.log`
7. **Test recurring jobs**: Verify jobs appear in logs at expected intervals
8. **Verify Tailwind CSS**: Check that `public/assets/tailwind-*.css` is 14KB+, not 491 bytes
9. **Test web app**: Visit production URL, verify UI loads with proper styling

## Key Learning: Solid Queue "Just Works"

Unlike Sidekiq/Redis setups that require:
- Separate Redis server
- Separate Sidekiq service/process
- Additional monitoring
- Redis persistence configuration

**Solid Queue requires ZERO additional setup**:
- Uses existing SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- Starts automatically with Rails server
- No external dependencies
- Built into Rails 8

This deployment proves Solid Queue is production-ready and simpler than previous background job solutions.
